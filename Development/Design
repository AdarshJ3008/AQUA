1. SENSOR INTEGRATION: 
->DS18B20 Temperature Sensor: Measures water temperature with high precision. 
->DHT11 Sensor: Simultaneously records temperature and humidity, providing a 
comprehensive environmental snapshot. 
->Turbidity Sensor: Evaluates water clarity by measuring the scattering and absorption of 
light. 
->TDS Sensor: Measures the total dissolved solids in the water, offering insights into water 
conductivity. 
2. ESP32 MICROCONTROLLER: 
->Acts as the central hub for data collection and processing. 
->Facilitates seamless communication between the embedded sensors. 
->Integrates Wi-Fi connectivity for transmission of data to the Thingspeak cloud server. 
3. CLOUD INTEGRATION (THINGSPEAK): 
->Establishes a secure connection with the Thingspeak cloud server for data storage and 
analysis. 
->Enables remote access to real-time water quality data through a user-friendly web 
interface. 
4. SCALABILITY: 
->The system is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the integration of additional 
sensors to address evolving monitoring need
